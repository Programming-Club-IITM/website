 * EVENTS DATA — Grouped by Event Series
 *
 * Structure:
 *   eventGroups[] → each group has a name + events[]
 *   Each event has a `slug` used for its internal route: /events/:slug
 *
 * Detail-page fields (all nullable — set null until real content is added):
 *   poster         – path to poster image (e.g., '/events/bitshift-poster.png')
 *   venue          – string (e.g., 'Online' or 'CLT, IIT Madras')
 *   time           – string (e.g., '5:00 PM – 7:30 PM')
 *   details        – long description / markdown text for the detail page
 *   registrationLink – external registration URL
 *   contestLink    – external contest/codeforces URL
 *   problemsetLink – external link to a problemset platform (e.g. HackerRank)
 *   problemSetters - list of strings of names
 *   teamconducted - list of strings of names
 *   slidesPdf      – path(s) to slides PDF(s) inside public folder
 *   problemsetPdf  – path(s) to problemset PDF(s) inside public folder
 *   solutionsPdf   – path(s) to solutions PDF(s) inside public folder
 *    category- past or upcoming
 *
 * TO ADD A NEW EVENT:
 *   1. Find the right group (or create a new one)
 *   2. Add an event object with a unique slug
 *   3. Set category: 'upcoming' for live events, 'past' when done
